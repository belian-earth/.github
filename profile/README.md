**Forest Conservation Science** — Rethinking counterfactual analysis for credible forest conservation baselines

[Website](https://belian.earth) • [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/belian-earth)

---

We're a small team working at the intersection of **geospatial data**, **causal inference**, and **Forest science**. Our goal is to build more transparent and credible approaches to understanding what would have happened to forests without conservation interventions.

### 🛠️ Our Toolbox

We love working with open source tools:

`R` • `DuckDB` • `GDAL`

### 📦 Open Source

We're just getting started, but we believe in sharing what we build:

- **[duckdb-r-editor](https://github.com/belian-earth/duckdb-r-editor)** — A Positron IDE extension for rich DuckDB SQL editing within R files

More to come ✨
